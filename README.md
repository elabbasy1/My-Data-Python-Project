# OverView

Welcome to my exploration of the data job market, with a focus on data analyst positions. This project was inspired by a desire to better understand and navigate job opportunities in the field. It examines the highest-paying and most sought-after skills to identify the best career prospects for data analysts.

The data used comes from Luke Barousse’s Python course as well as my python skills that I have developed in university, which serves as the foundation for this analysis and includes detailed insights on job titles, salary ranges, locations, and key skills. Using a collection of Python scripts, I address important questions such as which skills are most in demand, how salaries vary, and how skill demand aligns with compensation in the data analytics space.

## The following questions guide the focus of this project:
1.What are the most in-demand skills for the three most    popular roles in data?

2.How are the most in-demand skills evolving for Data Analyst roles?

3.What is the salary outlook for Data Analyst roles and their associated skills?

4.What are the most valuable skills for data analysts in terms of job demand and pay?


## Tools I used for this python project:

To dive deeper into the data analyst job market, I utilized a range of powerful tools.

Python served as the foundation of my analysis, enabling me to explore the data and uncover key insights. I leveraged several powerful Python libraries throughout the project:

Pandas – Used for data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib – Employed to create basic visualizations of the data.

Seaborn – Utilized for producing more advanced and aesthetically appealing charts.

To run my Python code and document my findings, I used:

Jupyter Notebooks – Ideal for combining code, outputs, and notes in a single environment.

Visual Studio Code – My primary editor for writing and executing Python scripts.

For version control and collaboration, I relied on:

Git & GitHub – Essential tools for tracking changes, managing code versions, and sharing my work effectively.


## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

This section details the process of preparing the data to ensure it is accurate and ready for analysis.

### Import & Clean Up Data using pandas, matplotlib, seborn and sns
I begin by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial cleaning steps to ensure data quality.


<pre> 
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
</pre>


## Filter Ireland jobs

To tailor my analysis to the Irish job market, I filter the dataset to include only roles located in Ireland


<pre> 

df_IR = df[df['job_country'] == 'Ireland']

 </pre>


 ## My Analysis

 Each Jupyter notebook in this project was designed to explore a specific aspect of the data job market. Here's how I addressed each question:


 ## 1.What are the most in-demand skills for the three most    popular roles in data?

 To identify the most in-demand skills for the top three most common data roles, I filtered the dataset to isolate the most frequently listed job titles. From there, I extracted the top five skills associated with each of these roles. This analysis highlights the most popular job titles and their key skills, helping me understand which competencies to prioritize based on the role I'm aiming for.

## Data Visualization



<pre> 

fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()

 </pre>


 ## Results

## Insights:

For both Data Analysts and Data Engineers, SQL is the most in-demand skill, appearing in more than 50% of job postings. In contrast, Python is the most commonly required skill for Data Scientists, showing up in 53% of listings.

Data Engineers tend to need more specialized technical expertise—such as AWS, Azure, and Spark—whereas Data Analysts and Data Scientists are typically expected to be skilled in broader data analysis and management tools like Excel and Tableau.

Python and SQL are versatile and highly sought-after skills across all three roles, with Python being especially prominent among Data Scientists (53%) as the most adaptable tool as well as SQL for data analayst.

In the context of data-related roles in Ireland, the least frequently requested skills offer insight into niche tool usage and potential areas for differentiation. For Data Analysts, Power BI appears as the least demanded skill, with only 21% of job postings referencing it. This may indicate a preference for broader tools like SQL and Excel in analytical roles.

Among Data Engineers, Apache Spark is the least mentioned, also at 21%. Despite its strength in big data processing, it seems to be a more specialized requirement, with many roles prioritizing foundational technologies like SQL and Python.

For Data Scientists, AWS stands out as the lowest in demand, appearing in just 14% of postings. This suggests that while cloud platforms are valuable, core statistical programming skills such as Python and R take precedence in these roles.



## 2.How are the most valued skills evolving for Data Analysts?

To analyze skill trends for Data Analysts in 2023, I filtered job postings specific to data analyst roles and organized the listed skills by month. This approach revealed the top five skills per month, highlighting how their popularity shifted over the course of the year.

 ## Results

![Salary for data jobs in Ireland](Images\plot3.png)


Box plot showing salary distributions for the top six data-related job titles.

# Insight: 


1. Among all data roles, Machine Learning Engineers clearly command the highest salaries in Ireland. The entire interquartile range (middle 50% of salaries) is significantly higher than the other roles, and even the lower bound starts above €100K. This suggests a strong demand for advanced AI and ML skills in the market, likely driven by their increasing adoption across industries.
2. Senior Titles Don’t Always Mean Higher Pay
Interestingly, Senior Data Engineers and Senior Data Scientists have narrower salary ranges compared to other roles, and their upper salary levels don’t surpass those of Machine Learning Engineers. This indicates that while senior roles suggest experience and responsibility, the niche skillset of ML Engineers is valued more highly — a reflection of market scarcity and specialization.


3. Data Analysts Have the Widest Pay Range at the Lower End
Data Analysts show the broadest salary distribution, especially on the lower end of the spectrum, with a wide interquartile range and several outliers. This could suggest that analyst roles are more accessible to early-career professionals, with pay increasing substantially with experience or industry, but also suffering from inconsistency in pay scales.


4. Outliers Hint at Exceptional Opportunities
Roles like Data Analyst and Data Scientist show a few outliers well above the interquartile range, indicating that while most professionals earn within a predictable band, some individuals are securing much higher salaries. These outliers may represent niche industry sectors, highly experienced individuals, or companies with aggressive compensation strategies to attract top talent.


5. Moderate Range for Data Engineers Suggests Stability
The salary distribution for Data Engineers is relatively stable and well-contained, with a solid interquartile range and fewer extreme values. This could reflect the maturing nature of this role in the industry — it’s in high demand, but employers have developed more consistent pay benchmarks over time.


## Top-Paying and Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I refined my analysis to focus specifically on data analyst roles. I examined both the top-paying skills and the most sought-after ones, presenting the findings using two bar charts.


##  Data Visualization

<pre> 

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analystsr')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()
 </pre>


 ## Results

 This is a breakdown of the top-paying and most in-demand skills for data analysts in Ireland.
